prompt: |
  You are a process mining assistant. Your task is to convert the following logical reasoning steps into a **generalized CSV event log format** for process mining analysis.
  🟡 Guidelines for Generalization:
  * You must use **only the following 20 fixed activity labels**:

  1. Start Problem
  2. Recall Definition
  3. Identify Known Results
  4. Formulate Strategy
  5. Apply Known Formula
  6. Simplify Expression
  7. Change of Variable
  8. Evaluate Limit or Integral
  9. Perform Comparison
  10. Apply Theorem
  11. Justify Step
  12. Explore Edge Cases
  13. Identify Contradiction
  14. Interpret Result
  15. Check Validity
  16. Verify With Example
  17. Refine or Change Strategy
  18. Conclude Final Result
  19. Recheck Original Question
  20. End Problem

  🔒 Constraints:

  * Do **not** invent new activity names or reword any of the above.
  * Use each activity label **according to its abstract logical purpose**—avoid math-specific jargon in the Activity column.
  * Each step should reflect one unit of reasoning and be concisely summarized in the Description.
  * Process the input line-by-line: for each non-empty line, output exactly one CSV row (Step) with one of the 20 Activity labels and a concise Description of that line.

  🔁 Example Output Format:
  Case ID,Step,Activity,Description
  1,01,Start Problem,"Problem: Find function g(x) such that ∫₀¹ xⁿe^{{-x}} dx < ∫₀¹ g(x) dx for all n ≥ 0 and ∫g = 1"
  1,02,Formulate Strategy,"Break down the problem into integral comparison and normalization constraints"
  1,03,Recall Definition,"Remember that xⁿ e^{{-x}} is bounded by e^{{-x}} on \[0,1]"
  1,04,Perform Comparison,"Compare ∫xⁿ e^{{-x}} dx with ∫e^{{-x}} dx = 1 - 1/e"
  1,05,Apply Known Formula,"Use integral of e^{{-x}} from 0 to 1 equals 1 - 1/e"
  1,06,Construct Expression,"Define candidate function g(x) = e^{{-x}} + c"
  1,07,Evaluate Limit or Integral,"Compute total integral ∫₀¹ g(x) dx = 1 - 1/e + c"
  1,08,Simplify Expression,"Solve for c such that total integral equals 1"
  1,09,Justify Step,"Argue that g(x) ≥ xⁿ e^{{-x}} for all x ∈ \[0,1]"
  1,10,Check Validity,"Ensure inequality is strict: ∫xⁿ e^{{-x}} dx < ∫g(x) dx"
  1,11,Conclude Final Result,"Final answer: g(x) = e^{{-x}} + 1/e"
  1,12,End Problem,"Problem solved with valid and verified solution"
